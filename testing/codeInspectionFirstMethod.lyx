is a too much generic word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
boolean success (line 1690):

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If one character variables are used, they are used only for temporary “throwaway
” variables, such as those used in for loops.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Throwable t (line 1713): 
\emph on
t
\emph default
 is a name for a Throwable variable that is only used twice, but should
 have a meaningful name as explained in the point above.
\end_layout

Consistent bracing style is used, either the preferred “Allman” style (first
 brace goes underneath the opening block) or the “Kernighan and Ritchie”
 style (first brace is on the same line of the instruction that opens the
 new block).
\end_layout

 comments, package/import statements, class/interface declarations which
 include class variable/attributes declarations, constructors, and methods).
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In this method, there shoudn't be the blank line at lines 1684 and 1687,
 but there should be one at line 1690 separating the variables declaration
 section of the method from the following section.
 Other blank lines are used correctly.
 Optional comments are not used.

\begin_layout Itemize
The variable
