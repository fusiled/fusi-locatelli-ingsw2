\begin_layout Enumerate
All class names, interface names, method names, class variables, method
 variables, and constants used should have meaningful names and do what
 the name suggests.

In this method there isn't any error of this kind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If one character variables are used, they are used only for temporary “throwaway
” variables, such as those used in for loops.

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In this method there isn't any error of this kind.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Class variables, also called attributes, are mixed case, but might begin
 with an underscore (‘_’) followed by a lowercase first letter.
 All the remaining words in the variable name have their first letter capitalize
d.

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In this method there isn't any error of this kind.

Three or four spaces are used for indentation and done so consistently.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In this method there isn't any error of this kind, because always four spaces
 are used for indentation.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
No tabs are used to indent.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

Consistent bracing style is used, either the preferred “Allman” style (first
 brace goes underneath the opening block) or the “Kernighan and Ritchie”
 style (first brace is on the same line of the instruction that opens the
 new block).
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In this method there isn't any error of this kind, because the “Kernighan

Blank lines and optional comments are used to separate sections (beginning
 comments, package/import statements, class/interface declarations which
 include class variable/attributes declarations, constructors, and methods).
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In this method, there shoudn't be the blank line at lines 1804, 1807, 1808
 and 1823, but there should be one at line 1798 separating the variables
 declaration section of the method from the following section.
 Optional comments are not used.

Line break occurs after a comma or an operator.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The line break at line 1819 should not be used.
 If the instructions at lines 1819 and 1820 were written on a single line
 the length of the line would be less than 80 characters so it would be
 right.
\end_layout

Comments are used to adequately explain what the class, interface, methods,
 and blocks of code are doing.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This condition is not completely respected, because this method lacks comments
 useful to understand what some blacks of code are doing.
 The only two comments used are at lines 1811 and 1817; they help to understand
 the next statements but other lines of code are unexplained.

 it can be removed from the source file if determined it is no longer needed
