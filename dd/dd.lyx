Overview (L)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The architecture we based our system on is the client-server architecture
 with two tiers.
 One tier (the server tier) is composed by the server logic and the database,
 the other tier (the client tier) is composed by the client logic and the
 GUI that allows the user to intract with the system.
 The fact that both the server and the client tiers have an aplication logic
 means that the application is distributed; this, added to the fact that
 we decided to use a service oriented architure, allows our system to be
 scalable, so other services can be added without modifying the structure
 of the system.
 For example, if a future implementation of the system needs a different
 type of client, the new client can use the same services provided by the
 server without modifying the implementation of its logic.
 Furthermore, using a two tier architecture allows our system to be easy
 to maintain and to repair if some of its components break.

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The three main high level components of the system are the front end, the
 service comunicator and the core of the system.
 The front end is used to allow customers and taxi drivers to interact with
 the system, so every customer can make requests and reservations and every
 taxi driver can accept or refuse a ride, appear available or not to the
 system etc.
 The core has the task to manage taxi queues and manage the comunication
 between customers and taxi drivers, by means of messages.
 Finally, the service comunicator has to ensure the comunication between
 the front end and the core, providing services to both the components.

Frontend
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The frontend must takes the input of users and present the several responses
 that the system generates for the user.
 Two different kinds of frontends are proposed: one for customers and one
 for taxi drivers.

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Considering that a client-server architecture has been chosen to implement
 the system, there are four elements in which the components have to be
 installed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Client (Customer)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This client contains the Frontend(Customer) component, so a user is able
 to submit a prestation (request or reservation) and to decide to accept
 or refuse a refusable message (this message is sent to the customer when
 the first taxi driver available is found outside the customer's zone).
 The customer's client is used on customer's smartphone or pcs, depending
 on his choise to use the app or webapp version of the service.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Client (Taxi)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This client contains the Frontend(Taxi) component and is used by the taxi
 driver to access every functionality that is available to him, such as
 accepting or refusing a request and appear available to the system.
 This client will be installed on the taxi driver's smartphone and it's
 important to focus on the fact that this version of the client will be
 only available on taxi drivers' smartphone, in this way customers cannot
 accept the services reserved to drivers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The two clients exchange data, by means of interfaces, with both the service
 register (that allows them to retrieve the services they have access to)
 and the service provider (that provides the two client with the services
 they are able to access, previously specified by the service register).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Server
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The server contains two components: the core (responsible for the execution
 of the main functionalities of the system) and the service provider (that
 allows clients to access the services they need).
 The service provider communicates with the service register to access the
 services that the clients are enabled to use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Web page
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The service register is located on a web page, so both the clients and the
 server can access it at any time and know which services can be used.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Spiegare come funzionano i servizi delle interfacce di client e server (in
 generale dato che vengono descritti nello specifico nei sequence diagrams).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Service Oriented Architecture.
 Service provider publishes type of services (request and reservation for
 clients).
